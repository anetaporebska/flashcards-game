{"question":"What is a detached HEAD and what causes this and how to avoid this?","answer":"Detached HEAD indicates that the currently checked-out repository is not a local branch. This can be caused by the following scenarios:     When a branch is a read-only branch and we try to create a commit to that branch, then the commits can be termed as “free-floating” commits not connected to any branch. They would be in a detached state.     When we checkout a tag or a specific commit and then we try to perform a new commit, then again the commits would not be connected to any branch. When we now try to checkout a branch, these new commits would be automatically placed at the top.","date":1635974035613,"level":2,"_id":"cdiC9ZbfTzyEW3jM"}

{"question":"[http] Message body","answer":"The body content of any HTTP message can be referred to as a message body or entity body. Technically, the entity body is the actual content of the message. The message body contains the entity body, which can be in its original state, or can be encoded in some way for transport, such as by being broken into chunks (chunked transfer-coding). The message body of a request may be referred to for convenience as a request body. Message bodies are appropriate for some request methods and inappropriate for others. For example, a request with the POST method, which sends input data to the server, has a message body containing the data. A request with the GET method, which asks the server to send a resource, does not have a message body.","date":1634390629550,"level":2,"_id":"uF0DIPIQSkMbPBTu"}
